# Income-Inequality-Polarization-GSS

The goal of this project was simple, I wanted to map out the relationship between Income Inequality and Political Polarization, as this is a topic 
of ongoing research and debate in the social sciences. 

There is a large body of literature that has explored this relationship from various perspectives, including political science, sociology, 
and economics. Some studies have found a positive relationship between income inequality and political polarization, implying that as income inequality increases, political polarization also increases. Other studies have found a negative relationship or no relationship between income inequality and political polarization. There are also studies that have suggested that the relationship between income inequality and political polarization is complex and may depend on factors such as the level of economic mobility, the nature of the political system, and the cultural and social values of a society.

I picked the The General Social Survey (GSS), which is a nationally representative survey that has been conducted since 1972. The data is publicly available on the GSS website (https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data). 

First, I loaded the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Then, I loaded the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset into a pandas dataframe. The dataset contains information on income, political attitudes, and various other demographic variables for individuals surveyed in each year.

Next, I cleaned and preprocessed the data by selecting relevant variables, filtering out missing values, and recoding variables as needed.

I computed measures of income inequality and political polarization for each year using the relevant variables in the dataset. For example, income inequality can be measured using the Gini coefficient or by comparing the income distribution of the top and bottom percentiles of the population, while political polarization can be measured using a variety of indicators such as party identification, ideological self-identification, and issue positions.

Then, I visualized the relationship between income inequality and political polarization using scatterplots and trendlines. This can be done using the seaborn library, which allows for easy customization of visualizations.

After that, I conducted statistical analysis to test the significance of the relationship between income inequality and political polarization, using techniques such as regression analysis and hypothesis testing.

Next, I interpreted the results of the analysis and drew conclusions about the relationship between income inequality and political polarization, taking into account the limitations and potential biases of the data and analysis methods used.

Finally, I documented the code, analysis, and results in a clear and organized manner, including comments and annotations to explain the thought process and reasoning behind each step. This documentation is then published on a public repository on Github for others to view and use.
