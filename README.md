# Income-Inequality-Polarization-GSS

This project investigates the relationship between income inequality and political polarization using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), which is a nationally representative survey that has been conducted since 1972. The goal of the project is to map out the relationship between these two variables and contribute to the ongoing research and debate in the social sciences.

# Data
The data for this project was obtained from the GSS website (https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data). The dataset contains information on income, political attitudes, and various other demographic variables for individuals surveyed in each year.

# Methodology
1. To investigate the relationship between income inequality and political polarization, the following steps were taken:
2. Load the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
3. Load the GSS dataset into a pandas dataframe and preprocess the data by selecting relevant variables, filtering out missing values, and recoding      variables as needed.
4. Compute measures of income inequality and political polarization for each year using the relevant variables in the dataset.
5. Visualize the relationship between income inequality and political polarization using scatterplots and trendlines, created using the seaborn library.
6. Conduct statistical analysis to test the significance of the relationship between income inequality and political polarization, using techniques such as regression analysis and hypothesis testing.
7. Interpret the results of the analysis and draw conclusions about the relationship between income inequality and political polarization, taking into account the limitations and potential biases of the data and analysis methods used.

# Results
The analysis found a positive relationship between income inequality and political polarization, suggesting that as income inequality increases, political polarization also increases. These results are consistent with some studies in the literature but not all, highlighting the complexity of this relationship.

# Conclusion
This project contributes to the ongoing research and debate on the relationship between income inequality and political polarization. By using publicly available data and open-source software, the project demonstrates the potential of data science and social science research to inform public policy and social issues.
