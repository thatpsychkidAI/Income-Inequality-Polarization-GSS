# Income-Inequality-Polarization-GSS

The goal of this project was simple, I wanted to map out the relationship between Income Inequality and Political Polarization, as this is a topic 
of ongoing research and debate in the social sciences. There is a large body of literature that has explored this relationship from various perspectives,
including political science, sociology, and economics.

Some studies have found a positive relationship between income inequality and political polarization, meaning that as income inequality increases, political polarization also increases. For example, a study by McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal (2006) found that the increasing income inequality in the United States since the 1970s has led to greater political polarization in Congress.

Other studies have found a negative relationship or no relationship between income inequality and political polarization. For example, a study by Grossmann and Hopkins (2016) found that income inequality has not led to increased polarization among the general public, but rather among political elites such as members of Congress.

There are also studies that have suggested that the relationship between income inequality and political polarization is complex and may depend on factors such as the level of economic mobility, the nature of the political system, and the cultural and social values of a society.
