# Income-Inequality-Polarization-GSS

The goal of this project was simple, I wanted to map out the relationship between Income Inequality and Political Polarization, as this is a topic 
of ongoing research and debate in the social sciences. 

There is a large body of literature that has explored this relationship from various perspectives, including political science, sociology, 
and economics. Some studies have found a positive relationship between income inequality and political polarization, implying that as income inequality increases, political polarization also increases. Other studies have found a negative relationship or no relationship between income inequality and political polarization. There are also studies that have suggested that the relationship between income inequality and political polarization is complex and may depend on factors such as the level of economic mobility, the nature of the political system, and the cultural and social values of a society.
